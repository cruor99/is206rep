Repository for IS-206 assignments
Within are the two programming assignments for the course IS-206, Open Source software.
Assignment 2 contains exercises from Learn Python the Hard Way, while assignment 3 contains work derived
from the lessons of Udacity's CS253 course. 

Assignment 3 can be found running at http://206assign3.appspot.com/.
=======================
In order to run exercise 52, make sure you are in the gothonweb directory and type 
python bin/app.py in your console. 

An error might occur when accessing the webpage, which might show as 'NonType object has no attribute _help'
To do this, just go / instead of /game. Unsure as to why this occurs.

Also make sure you have set your pythonpath, otherwise you might encounter errors. This is done through
$ export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:.
========================

In order to run exercise 45, type the following in your console:
$ python ex45init.py

This will run the small program.
